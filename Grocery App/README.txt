Requirements:

Flask==2.3.2
Flask-SQLAlchemy==3.0.5
matplotlib==3.7.1

How to run?

app.py is the main file. Running this single file either through interpreter or command line(python3 run app.py) invokes the python server in localhost : http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 

Rest of the functionalities works in web itself.
